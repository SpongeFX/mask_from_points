### Mask From Points 1.0 is a Houdini SideFX digital asset for point masking, based on infection simulation(transferring mask attribute between neighboring points), allowing the creation and control of mask activators on animated objects.


[![demo](https://spongefx.art/asset/media/public/simshot.mp4)](https://github.com/SpongeFX/simshot/assets/152398516/8f4dfd2c-98bf-4934-b3d4-8d5e296b0c8d)


The asset enables creating curves on polygonal objects by mouse click in the viewport and using these curves as attribute spreading activators between points. The created curves are attached to polygons and inherit all their transformations (if the polygonal object on which the curve is created moves, the curve will move along with it). Asset settings also allow controlling the speed and shape of mask spreading, smoothing the curves' shape, managing scatter to create masked points, applying parent transformations to these points, assigning the @orient attribute to points, and changing the rotation angle.


## üíæ  Installation 
[Download the HDA file](otls/sop_mask_from_points.1.0.hdalc) and install it to your `houdini20/otls/` folder. For detailed instructions, please refer to the [Houdini documentation](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/assets/install.html)

    <tr>
        <td width="50%">         
            <p><b>1</b>. Connect polygonal objects to <i>input1</i>.</p>
            <p><b>2</b>. Select the asset in the Network View, activate "Show Handle," and use mouse clicks in the viewport to create curves* on the surface of objects.<br>
            *To move to creating the next curve, change the value of the Group parameter.</p>
            <p><b>3</b>. Set the value of the "<i>Carve</i>" parameter(individually for each curve) to a value more than 0.</p>
            <p><b>4</b>. Adjust parameters affecting the speed and shape of mask spreading if need.</p>
            <p><b>5</b>. Visualize to <i>output2</i> and activate the timeline.</p>

</table>

#### Recommendations:
- If the connected primitives in input1 have an "xform" attribute with the primitive transformation matrix, turn off the "GetXFORM" toggle in the "IncomingGeometry" tab. This will cancel unnecessary computations and improve the asset's performance.

## üìÇ Tabs and Parameters

### üìÅ Default Parameters

This tab contains the settings for simulating and creating curves. 

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="18%"><i>Group Name</i></td>
        <td colspan="2"><p>The name of the point group where primitives are created. To finish creating the current primitive and move to the next one, change the value of this parameter.</p></td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="18%"><i>Reset</i></td>
        <td colspan="2"><p>Remove all created curves.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="18%"><i>Carve #</i></td>
        <td colspan="2"><p>The mask attribute value based on the curve length. Increasing parameter values from 0 to 1 increases the mask attribute value for points on the curve. This parameter is unique for each curve.</p></td>
    </tr>   
</table>

<br>

### üìÅ Resample and Smooth Curves
In this tab, you'll find settings for adding mask activators points to created curves or geometry connected to <i>input2</i>, as well as settings for smoothing the curves created by the asset. The settings are identical to the SOP nodes "Resample" and "Smooth".

<br/>

### üìÅ Scatter

This tab contains settings for adding points to geometry connected to <i>input1</i>. The settings are identical to the SOP node Scatter and differ only by the presence of one additional parameter, which adds volume and allows creating points inside objects rather than on their surface. 

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="18%"><i>Volume From Geomerty</i></td>
        <td colspan="2"><p>Creates a volume from closed polygonal objects and uses the volume for scatter. Enabling this toggle opens the parameters for volume resolution settings identical to the "IsoOffset" SOP node.</p></td>

### üìÅ Incomming Geomerty

This tab contains settings necessary to obtain the transformation matrix from incoming polygons. Use this if your geometry does not contain a primitive attribute <i>@xform</i> with a transformation matrix4.

        <td valign="top" width="18%"><a id="expmode"></a><i>Get XFORM</i></td>
        <td><p>Enabling activates the calculation of the transformation matrix4 using a faster but less efficient method.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><i>Get XFORM for each primitive</i></td>
        <td><p>Enabling activates the calculation of the transformation matrix4 for each primitive. This method works with deforming objects. It is a more efficient method but may take more time.
